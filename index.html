    <h1>3 ways you can bless our family during this time:</h1>
    <h2>1. Help us stock the freezer!</h2>
    <p>Bring a freezer meal with you to the party, so we can make sure that we have plenty of healthy, homemade meals to eat during the postpartum period. We aren't picky eaters at all. All we ask is that the meal is balanced with a prioritization of animal protein and vegetables to help with faster recovery for mom. If you have any questions, please feel free to text Kenisa at 770-778-2276. <br><br>Need some help coming up with recipe ideas? Click the link below to check out Kenisa's Pinterest board called "Freezer Meals", and feel free to explore the board, "Treat Yo Self" for even more inspiration.</p>
    <a class="link" href="https://www.pinterest.com/kenisa/treat-yo-self/freezer-meals/" target="_blank">Get inspired</a>
    <h2>2. Donate to help kids around the world!</h2><p>The Lord has kept his hand of provision over our family in a miraculous way, and we are not in need of any material items for baby #2. Instead of a gift, we would ask that you donate whatever amount of money you had in mind to spend on us to O.U.R. Rescue, an organization that saves children from sex trafficking and sexual exploitaion both internationally and domestically. We have started a fundraiser in honor of this celebration of life in our family, and the first donation has come from us to the amount of $50 which has been dedicated to our unborn daughter. <br><br>To learn more about the organization and to donate to our fundraiser, click the link below.</p>
    <a class="link" href="https://ourrescue.org/?form=FUNBUXKNBMB&fundraiser=NWYCAPYQ" target="_blank">Donate here</a>
    <h2>3. Express your personal love language!</h2><p>We understand that some people love to have a physical gift to give. Gift giving is one of the 5 love languages after all. If you are one of those people, please feel welcome to give a piece of your heart to our little girl. Below is an Amazon list of items that we would be honored to receive.</p>
